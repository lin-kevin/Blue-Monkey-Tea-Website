# Blue Monkey Tea Website

Frontend development project for small local tea shop in Pittsburgh. Includes original CSS template and various interactive features from the JQuery, Lightbox, and Highcharts JavaScript libraries. 

Images of each page can be found in the "webpages" folder. The interface is not final, as filler text was provided and used throughout.
