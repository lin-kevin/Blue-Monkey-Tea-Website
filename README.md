# Blue Monkey Tea Website

Frontend development project for small local tea shop in Pittsburgh. Includes original CSS template and various interactive features from the JQuery, Lightbox, and Highcharts JavaScript libraries. 

## Images 
Images of each page can be found in the "webpages" folder. The interface is not final, as filler text was provided and used throughout.
