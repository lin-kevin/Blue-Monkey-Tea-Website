# Blue Monkey Tea Website

Frontend development project for small local tea shop in Pittsburgh. Includes original CSS template and various interactive features from the JQuery, Lightbox, and Highcharts JavaScript libraries. 

## Images 
Full-sized images of each page can be found in the "webpages" folder. The interface is not final, as filler text was provided and used throughout.  

<span>
  <img align="top" name="home" src="/webpages/home.png" width=20%>
  <img align="top" name="about" src="/webpages/about.png" width=20%>
  <img align="top" name="menu" src="/webpages/menu.png" width=20%>
  <img align="top" name="contact" src="/webpages/contact.png" width=20%>
</span>
