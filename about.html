        <h3> HISTORY </h3>
        <p>
            The original store was established in May of 2002. It was named 
            Wicks & Beans, as the original merchandise consisted mostly of 
            scented candles and coffee beans. We were located at 2207 Murray Ave, 
            also in Squirrel Hill (down and across from Mineo's Pizza.) Despite 
            the small space, we expanded our assortments, eventually also selling 
            teas and international sweets. Well, it was getting tight, so we were 
            very happy to move to a much larger space at 5872 Forbes Ave in July 
            of 2006 and change the name of the store to Margaret's Fine Imports.
            Since then we've become mostly a Tea Specialty store with over 400 
            varieties of teas in stock, and a huge assortment of teapots and 
            tea gadgets. We even sell items like tea cozies and tea wallets!
            We offer Tea Classes and Tea Tastings every month. We also carry 
            over 30 types of coffee beans and some neat coffee makers!
            Apart from that we also attend to the sweet tooth of our customers 
            by stocking up on international sweets, especially around Holidays.
            We offer excellent service and we enjoy interacting with our 
            customers: repeat and new! On May 9th, 2017 we opened a store in 
            Carnegie and changed both store names to Blue Monkey Tea. The 
            Carnegie PA location moved to Pittsburgh in February of 2019.
            Whose a good Blue Monkey Tea? We are a good Blue Monkey Tea! And 
            we are here to serve you! We changed our name, in an attempt, 
            to brand ourselves nationwide.

        <h3> OUR OWNER </h3>
        <p>
            Margaret Harris is the owner of Blue Monkey Tea, tea & gourmet food 
            store in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. As one of Pittsburgh's primary 
            tea experts, Margaret Harris is a tea consultant and regularly 
            conducts classes and workshops on tea at a variety of venues, 
            including colleges, clubs, associations, corporations, and at her 
            store. As a native of Poland, where tea is the primary household 
            beverage, her lifelong experience with tea began quite early: she 
            may have had her first "cup of tea" when she was only one day old! 
            Margaret is a graduate of the Warsaw Medical College, which has 
            enabled her to incorporate her medical knowledge into her teachings 
            on the health aspects of teas and tisanes. Margaret is a founding 
            member of the Western Pennsylvania Tea Business Association, as well 
            as several other business and professional groups.
            Blue Monkey Tea was called Margaret's Fine Imports and before 
            that Wicks and Beans.
